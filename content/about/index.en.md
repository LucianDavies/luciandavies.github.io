## Hi, I'm Tonderai

I'm a senior software engineer based in Berlin, currently working at **Klarna** on banking products — transaction lifecycles, mapping engines, and payment processing systems.

My day-to-day revolves around **Node.js** and **TypeScript**, and I'm increasingly drawn to **Rust** for performance-critical work. Over the years I've built everything from API wrappers handling airtime transfers across 20+ countries to permission modules for Koa.js.

### What this blog is about

This is where I document problems I've solved — for myself and sometimes at work. Expect posts on debugging tricky production issues, system design decisions, integration patterns, and the occasional deep-dive into a language feature or tool that made my life easier.
